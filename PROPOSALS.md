# Proposed Improvements for Ruby Development Environment

This document summarizes potential optimizations and robustness improvements identified while reviewing the repository.

## Dockerfile

- **Cache efficiency**: Use multi-stage builds or dedicated `--mount=type=cache` for `bundle install` to further reduce image size and build time.
- **Locale configuration**: Consider installing only required locales to keep the image slim.
- **User permissions**: Verify that the created user has UID/GID mapping to avoid permission issues when mounting host volumes.
- **Gem versions**: Pin versions in a Gemfile instead of installing them directly via `gem install`.

## `entrypoint.sh`

- **Help output**: Add a usage function that describes the available commands when no arguments are supplied.
- **Input validation**: Warn or fail fast if an unknown command is provided, rather than blindly executing it.
- **Logging**: Introduce optional debug logging controlled via an environment variable (`DEBUG=1`).

## `ruby-functions.zsh`

- **Bundle install check**: Compare timestamps of `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` instead of a fixed 24h window to decide when to run `bundle install`.
- **Error propagation**: Ensure every helper returns non-zero on failure so calling functions can handle errors appropriately.
- **Docker image presence**: Before running commands, verify the `ruby-dev` image exists and provide guidance if not.
- **Configuration detection**: Simplify argument parsing in wrappers (e.g., `rubocop`) to rely on builtâ€‘in detection while providing override options.

## Testing

- Add automated unit tests for helper functions where feasible.
- Integrate continuous integration (CI) to run `shellcheck`, `zsh -n`, and project tests on each commit.

These optimizations aim to improve developer experience and container robustness while keeping maintenance overhead low.
